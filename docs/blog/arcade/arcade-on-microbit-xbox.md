# MakeCode Arcade - now more ways to play!

**Posted on November 6th, 2023 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

Great news for MakeCode Arcaders... we’re releasing some updates today that will allow you to play the Arcade games you create on micro:bits and on an Xbox!

## MakeCode Arcade on micro:bit

That’s right! We’re crossing the streams! Now you can download your [MakeCode Arcade]( https://arcade.makecode.com) games on to a micro:bit! All you need is a [micro:bit v2](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/) and an Arcade shield expansion board that includes a screen and buttons/joystick. Several hardware partners have already launched these micro:bit accessories, and we hope to see more!

[Kittenbot](https://www.kittenbot.cc/) was the first to create an Arcade accessory for the micro:bit. The [Newbit]( https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield) is a cute, cat-themed board with red and blue buttons, pins and a [Jacdac](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs) connector.

[Elecfreaks](https://www.elecfreaks.com/) makes a polished-looking micro:bit [Retro]( https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/micro-bit-retro-programming-arcade) expansion board with nice hand-holds, yellow buttons, an acrylic case, pins and a [Jacdac](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs) connector.

[ICShop](https://www.icshop.com.tw/) from Taiwan has the [Game:Bit](https://www.icshop.com.tw/products/368112100137) which sports a larger screen, plastic case, and joystick.

The micro:bit v2 has enough memory to hold 1 Arcade game, so you can use it as a game cartridge - if you have multiple micro:bits, you can swap different games in and out on a long road trip! For educators, this is a great way to take your classroom micro:bits even further and move from physical computing into game development.

## MakeCode Arcade on Xbox

Move over [Halo](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) and [Forza](https://forza.net/), now you can play your own games on Xbox! The [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade Kiosk]( https://www.xbox.com/games/store/makecode-arcade-kiosk/9p3rgvvtvb1s) app in the Xbox Store allows you to upload the games you create with MakeCode Arcade onto an Xbox and play them on the big screen with a game controller. There are 20 pre-loaded Arcade games available to play including Space Destroyer and Bunny Hop. To play your own games on Xbox, download and install the app, then select the **Add your game** button. You will see a unique Kiosk ID appear.
