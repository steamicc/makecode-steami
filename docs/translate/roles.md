# Translation roles

Crowdin is a crowd-sourced translation platform with two main actors: **translators** and **proofreaders**.
**Translators** add new translations or vote for existing translations. Once a translation is available, a **proofreader** needs
to **validate** it in order to appear on the MakeCode web sites.

### Translator

As a translator you select text from a strings file or markdown page. In this case, the tutorial file ``dice.md`` is selected.

A particular string is then selected to translate.

Over in the translation editor you type in your suggested translation and press **SAVE**.

Once your translation is saved, it moves down into the suggested translations list. There could be other translation suggestions listed there too. You can review those to help form your new translation or possibly someone else has come up with a better one. If some part of a string your working on was already translated, Crowdin may offer a suggestion using some of the previous translated text.

### Proofreader

Proofreaders review new translations and approve or disapprove suggestions. A suggestion is approved by pressing the **Approve** button (a checkmark) next to it.
