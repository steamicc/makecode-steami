# WebUSB

[WebUSB](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/) is a recent and developing web feature that allows you to access a @boardname@ directly from a web page. With MakeCode it allows for **one-click** downloads to your @boardname@ without installing an additional app or other software! It also lets you directly receive data into the MakeCode editor from the @boardname@.

#### WebUSB support for your @boardname@

If you're not using a current version of the Chrome or Microsoft Edge browsers, make sure they are this version or newer:

* Chrome (version 79 and newer) browser for Android, Chrome OS, Linux, macOS and Windows 10.
* Microsoft Edge (version 79  and newer) browser for Android, Chrome OS, Linux, macOS and Windows 10.

Also, if you have a [@boardname@ V1 board](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000119162-how-to-identify-the-version-number-of-your-micro-bit), make sure that it is running version **0249** or above of the firmware. Upgrading is as easy as dragging a file to a folder and it takes a few seconds to get it done.
