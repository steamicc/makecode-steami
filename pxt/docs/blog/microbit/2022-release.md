# MakeCode for the micro:bit – Buzz, Beep, Bing, Hello 2022 Update!

**Posted on June 17, 2022 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

As always at this time of year we have a new MakeCode release for the micro:bit that is jam-packed full of improvements, bug fixes, and new stuff.

Here’s a rundown of the new features in the 2022 release:

## Play Sound editor

With more [micro:bit v2](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/v2) devices in classrooms, we’ve seen how students absolutely love using the speaker and microphone to create and detect sounds. So, as another way to support increased creativity in coding, we’ve expanded the capabilities of the Play Sound block so now students can create their own custom sound effects for the micro:bit!

### New blocks

## Finding and Using Extensions

With over 300 different extensions for the micro:bit supporting all sorts of amazing kits and accessories, it was getting harder to find the right extension and the extension gallery was a bit hidden. So, we’ve moved the **Extensions** category out of the **Advanced** part of the Toolbox, and we’ve made it easier to find extensions through tags and search.

## Data Logger Extension

We first introduced this last year, but we’ve made some significant improvements. The data logger blocks allow you to collect and store data on a micro:bit v2. This is helpful if you are running an experiment over a longer period of time or disconnected from a computer.

### Data Logging Example

## Jacdac for micro:bit v2

We are delighted to announce the public debut of Microsoft's [Jacdac platform](https://aka.ms/jacdac) for plug-and-play creation and programming of physical computing systems. Jacdac integrates with MakeCode and the micro:bit V2: see the [Jacdac blog](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/blog/jacdac-for-makecode-and-microbit/) for more details.

## Workspace Search

If you have a large program, it can be time consuming scrolling around, looking for that function or variable on your workspace. We’ve added the ability to search for blocks on your workspace by pressing **Ctrl+f** or right-clicking to open the context menu and selecting **Find**.

## Toolbox Polish

We added some cosmetic improvements to the **Toolbox** including updated icons and more subcategories in menus to make finding blocks a bit easier.

## Sharing

We also made some small improvements to sharing projects. These allow you to include a description for your project and share your projects to more places.

## Utilities

These aren't specific updates to the editor, but we’ve added some cool new utilities to help teachers.

### 1) Screenshot Tool

Sometimes you would like to take a screenshot of a single code block, but it’s disabled on the workspace unless you connect it to other blocks. This tool allows you to paste in the JavaScript code for a single block, click **Run** and then copy the resulting .svg image

**Screenshot Tool - https://makecode.com/screenshot-tool**

### 2) Domain Firewall Detection

The number one question we receive from schools and teachers is what websites to unblock in order to use MakeCode. We’ve added a tool to make this easy to test! Clicking on the **Test Domains** button will automatically test whether you can reach all the required sites from your location.

**Check the FAQ for testing domains - https://makecode.microbit.org/faq#unblock**
