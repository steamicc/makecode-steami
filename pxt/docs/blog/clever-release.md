# MakeCode Clever Integration Released!

Just in time for the fall semester, MakeCode has integrated with [Clever](https://www.clever.com/)!

Today, you can find our apps [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://clever.com/library/app/makecode-arcade) and [Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit](https://clever.com/library/app/makecode-microbit) by searching for them in the [Clever Library](https://clever.com/library).

Authorizing our apps means your entire classroom gains instant access to MakeCode Arcade and MakeCode for micro:bit through their Clever account.

Because we store projects and progress info securely in the cloud, students can easily start working in the classroom and can continue at home! To link with Clever, use the fancy new **Clever** button when signing in to our sites.

If you can't find our apps in the Clever Library, it's possible you're in a district that allows apps for classroom use only on a case-by-case basis. Please contact your district admins for help with allowing our apps within your district. For any issues you run into, please reach out to [@MSMakeCode](https://twitter.com/MSMakeCode), make a post in our forum's [Educator Lounge](https://forum.makecode.com/c/educators-lounge/24) in our forum, or [file a bug on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/issues/new/choose).

Please note that Microsoft takes student data privacy very seriously - if you have any questions about this, please consult [Microsoft's Privacy Policies](https://privacy.microsoft.com/), or the [MakeCode Privacy FAQ](https://makecode.com/privacy-faq).

Happy Making and Coding!
