It's hard to believe the academic year is almost over and Summer is on the horizon! Even so, this is a great time to start planning some professional development between those camping and road trips.

For educators who are planning to teach [AP Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles), and are interested in using the [AP CS Principles with Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.com/csp) curriculum, we have free professional development opportunities available!

The **AP CS Principles with Microsoft MakeCode** curriculum is free and uses web-based technology and tools that can be accessed across platforms and devices. The curriculum is endorsed and approved by the [College Board](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org) and uses [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com) and game-based learning for increased student engagement. Learn more about the curriculum at: https://makecode.com/csp.

There are 3 free online workshops available this summer for **teachers** interested in using this curriculum next year. Each workshop covers the same material – we are just offering 3 different sections to accommodate summer schedules. Each workshop has limited capacity, so register soon at the links below:

* [Workshop 1](https://microsoftedu.eventbuilder.com/MicrosoftMakeCodeWorkshop1): Tuesdays and Thursdays for 2 weeks, June 7th, 9th, 14th, and 16th
* [Workshop 2](https://microsoftedu.eventbuilder.com/MicrosoftMakeCodeWorkshop2): Daily, Tuesday - Friday, June 28th - July 1st
* [Workshop 3](https://microsoftedu.eventbuilder.com/MicrosoftMakeCodeWorkshop3): Wednesdays once a week, July 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th

These professional development workshops will focus on the AP Computer Science Principles course’s Big Ideas, Learning Objectives, and Essential Knowledge skills. Additionally, you will learn how Microsoft MakeCode’s curriculum meets the course’s learning objectives and prepares students for the AP Exam and Create Performance Task. By attending the training and using Microsoft MakeCode’s curriculum, you will be equipped with a syllabus, a pacing plan, lesson plans, PowerPoints, student handouts, and resources for every day of the course.

For educators who would like to receive graduate credits that can be used for their local school clock hour reimbursement, or recertification credits, this option is also available for a fee. Please let the instructor know at the beginning of the course if you want to use this option.

If you can’t make it to one of our online workshops, you can learn more about the curriculum through a [1-hour online course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/teach-ap-computer-science-principles-makecode) or by watching this [30-minute video](https://youtu.be/SZtBqDp18Qo).
